# hello-world
A space to think, create, move forth and evolve.
I'm fairly new to the software development world. But I'm here and ready to go!
I have a B.S. in applied mathematics, but have a passion for technology!
I am also an art guru!! Hoping to connect my artistic tendencies, math skills and my passion for software!!
